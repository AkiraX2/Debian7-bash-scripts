LEMP is a solution stack of php web-server composed with components here:
* Linux (Debian7)
* Nginx
* PHP (php5&php5-fpm&php-apc)
* MariaDB 10.0.x
 ...
###Why is LEMP?
LEMP is a efficient & light & morden web-server-build choice. So it made sure that it's high-performance and easy-to-use even build.
* Why is Linux and Debian7?
Linux ...
Debian is great. Stable, easy-use and take less space & memory with apt/dpkg/gdebi commands :) - I think it's the best choice for personal use or Centos for enterprise.
* Why is Nginx?
Nginx ... - the most popular web server, faster than apache and less memory, even its features is more powerful. So why not?
* Why is PHP?
We don't wanna talk about this. It's your choice, right? But php5-fpm is the best way for fastcgi. Apc is a great way to speed up php execution.
* Why is MariaDB and 10.0.x?
If you still wanna talk about Mysql, I suggest you to ask google, fedore or mozila
Binary compatible with mysql with lots of additional features. So just try and you will like it.
